        This pasta is all about the shallots, cooked down in a bath of olive oil
        to a jammy, caramelized paste. Tomato paste is there for tanginess, and
        anchovies for saltiness, but they serve more as background flavors to
        the sweetness of the shallot. This recipe makes enough caramelized
        shallot mixture for a double batch of pasta, or simply keep it
        refrigerated to spoon over fried eggs, or to serve underneath crispy
        chicken thighs or over roasted root vegetables like carrots or sweet
        potatoes.

      <h3>PREPARATION</h3>

      <p class="step">STEP 1</p>
      <p>
        Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium high.
        Add shallots and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and pepper.
        Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have become totally
        softened and caramelized with golden-brown fried edges, 15 to 20
        minutes.
      </p>

      <p class="step">STEP 2</p>
      <p>
        Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies. (No need to chop the anchovies;
        they will dissolve on their own.) Stir to melt the anchovies into the
        shallots, about 2 minutes.
      </p>

      <p class="step">STEP 3</p>
      <p>
        Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
        constantly to prevent any scorching, until the tomato paste has started
        to cook in the oil a bit, caramelizing at the edges and going from
        bright red to a deeper brick red color, about 2 minutes. Remove from
        heat and transfer about half the mixture to a resealable container,
        leaving the rest behind. (These are your leftovers to be used elsewhere:
        in another batch of pasta or smeared onto roasted vegetables, spooned
        over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy chicken thighs.)
      </p>

      <p class="step">STEP 4</p>
      <p>
        To serve, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of
        salted boiling water until very al dente (perhaps more al dente than
        usual). Transfer to Dutch oven with remaining shallot mixture (or a
        skillet if you are using the leftover portion) and 1 cup pasta water.
        Cook over medium-high heat, swirling the skillet to coat each piece of
        pasta, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any bits on the
        bottom, until pasta is thick and sauce has reduced and is sticky, but
        not saucy, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </p>

      <p class="step">STEP 5</p>
      <p>
        In a small bowl, combine parsley and finely chopped garlic clove, and
        season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide pasta among bowls, or transfer
        to one large serving bowl, and top with parsley mixture and a bit more
        red-pepper flakes, if you like.
